	This is the first time I have ever written a paragraph in notepad for a html. I find it to be pretty cool that all I needed to do was place the text I wanted visible to the viewer in between some tags. I feel having this type of skill will be very useful for my upcoming website project in my CS 1100 class. But enough about class what about me huh. So I was born in Atlanta, GA and am interested in a plethora of items. One of them is this MOBA called Smite, which was made by Hi-Rez Studios, which I really enjoy playing. Another interest of mine is Japanese manga. If you want to check them out I put a link below this paragraph.

<h3>Here's the Hi-Rez link:</h3>

<p>If you want to know what the game looks like here are some images below and a click either picture to go to the download site.<br>

<p>One thing that I can also do is make this neat table.<br>
	<table>
		<tr>
        			<td>Empty Table Space</td>
        			<td>Favorites as child</td>
       			<td>Favorites as a teen</td>
    		</tr>
   		<tr>
        			<td>Pokemon</td>
        			<td>Yes</td>
        			<td>Yes</td>
    		</tr>
    		<tr>
        			<td>Smite</td>
        			<td>No</td>
        			<td>Yes</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
